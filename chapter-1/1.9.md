# Exercise 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines
a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the
procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and
dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```racket
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Answer

First one:

```racket

; (define (+ a b)
;   (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (inc 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 6))))
(inc (inc (inc 7)))
(inc (inc 8))
(inc 9)
9

```

The process above is recursive, because we delay the execution of `inc`.

Second one:

```racket

; (define (+ a b)
;   (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9

```

The process above is iterative, since we keep all state in procedure parameters.

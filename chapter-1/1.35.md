# Exercise 1.34:

Suppose we define the procedure

```racket
(define (f g) (g 2))
```

Then we have

```racket
(f square)
4
```

```racket
(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6
```

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination `(f f)`? Explain.

Answer: we'll have an infinite loop, because `f` will be called recursively without any terminal case.

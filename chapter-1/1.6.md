# Exercise 1.6

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to
be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as
an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s
friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of if:

```racket
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
    (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```racket
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
; 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
; 0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root
program:

```racket
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
    guess
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa aempts to use this to compute
square roots? Explain.

## Answer

To evaluate an application of a procedure, we have
to evaluate it's operands first. If we'll try to implement condition
this way, and use it in a recursive procedure, we will receive
an infinite loop, because both branches of a terminal condition
will be evaluated. In example above, `sqrt-iter` will be evaluated
infine amount of times.

; Exercise 1.44

; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing.
; If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is
; the function whose value at a point x is the average of f (x âˆ’ dx), f (x), and f (x+dx).
; Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns
; a procedure that computes the smoothed f. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly
; smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain
; the n-fold smoothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function
; of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.

# Exercise 1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians)
can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x ≈ x
if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

```
sin x = 3 * sin(x / 3) - 4 * (sin(x / 3) ^ 3)
```

to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of
this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its
magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are
incorporated in the following procedures:

```racket
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
    angle
    (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

1. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine
12.15) is evaluated?

Calls will look like this:
```racket
(p sine (/ 12.15 3.0))
(p sine (/ 4 3.0))
(p sine (/ 1.3499999999999999 3.0))
(p sine (/ 0.44999999999999996 3.0))
(p sine (/ 0.15 3.0))
```

So answer is 5.

2. What is the order of growth in space and number of
steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated
by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

Answer:

Memory consumption will be constant, since the sine process is iterative, and order of growth of steps seems to be close to O(log n).

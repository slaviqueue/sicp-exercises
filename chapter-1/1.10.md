# Exercise 1.10

The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermannâ€™s function.

```racket
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
    ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
    ((= y 1) 2)
    (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```racket
(A 1 10) ; 1024
(A 2 4) ; 65536
(A 3 3) ; 65536
```

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```racket
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n^2.

1. `(f n)` multiplies `n` by 2.
2. `(g n)` calculates 2^n
